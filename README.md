# My GitHub Pages Site

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and serves as a static website.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple static website created to demonstrate how to host a webpage using GitHub Pages. The site includes a single HTML file that displays a welcome message.

## Getting Started
